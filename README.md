# ðŸ“˜ Spring Boot, JPA & Hibernate - Zero to Mastery (Course Practice)

This repository contains my practice code and mini projects from the Udemy course:  
**[Spring, Spring Boot, Spring Data JPA & Hibernate - Zero to Mastery](https://www.udemy.com/course/spring-springboot-jpa-hibernate-zero-to-master/?kw=master+spring+6&src=sac&couponCode=LETSLEARNNOW)**

## ðŸš€ What I'm Learning

- Core Spring Framework concepts
- Spring Boot auto-configuration and structure
- Dependency Injection and Inversion of Control (IoC)
- Spring Data JPA and Hibernate ORM
- Entity relationships (OneToOne, OneToMany, ManyToMany)
- Query methods and JPQL
- Transactions, EntityManager, and repositories

# **Core Spring Framework concepts:**
 **â€¢ Spring Core:** 
 - The :heart: of the entire spring. <br />
 - Contains Base framework classes, principles and mechanisms. <br />
 - Spring framework and other projects are built on top of "Spring Core". <br />
 - Contains importent components:  <br />
 1. ```IOC``` (Inversion of control): [Principal/Concept] &rarr; A software design concept where the control of object creation and their dependency management is inverted from the program (developer) to a framework/container. <br />
 2. ```DI``` (Dependency Injection): [Implementation Pattern] &rarr; Design pattern used to implement IoC by allowing the injection of a class's dependencies from outside (by the IoC container) rather than the class creating them itself. <br />
 3. ```Beans``` : - Normal Object/ POJO (plain old java object) &rarr; Created and managed by "IOC Container". <br />
 - Defined using config. metadata (XML Config or Annotation). <br />
 4. ```IOC Container```: [Spring Factory] &rarr; Container that: 1- creates beans 2- Manage their lifecycle 3- Injects dependency (via DI). <br />
   - Types: <br />
   1- ```Bean Factory``` &rarr; Lazy initialization. <br />
   2- ```Application Context``` &rarr; More advanced (used is most spring apps). <br />
 5. ```Context ``` (Application Context) : [Spring Brain] &rarr; advance version of IOC Container. <br />
   - Extra features: International support, Event propagation, AOP integration, Easier access to environ./ config. <br />
 6. ```SpEl ``` (Spring Expression Language): Let you write small expressions inside annotations or XML to (Access Values/ Call Methods/ do math). <br />
   ``` @Value("#{2 + 3}") ``` &rarr; ```#``` is used to reference beans, methods, or expressions. <br />
  ``` @Value("${app.name}")``` or ```@Value("#{myBean.someMethod()}") ``` &rarr; ``` $``` Gets value from application.properties. <br />

 **â€¢ ðŸ”’ Spring Security:** 
 - :zap: Powerful ```Authentication``` & ```access-control``` framework. <br />
 - With a minimum of configuration, it provides ```Authentication``` & ```Authorization``` & ```Protection``` against common attacks (CSRF , CORs) using out of the box features. <br />
 - Good integration with ```Authentication providers``` as: JWT (Java web access token), OAuth2 and LDAP. <br />
 - Dependency:
   ```
  	<dependency>
			<groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
			<artifactId>spring-boot-starter-security</artifactId>
		</dependency>
   ```

-  **Spring Security Functions**: <br />

| Method        | Purpose                                                                                                                                          | 
|---------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `defaultSecurityFilterChain()` | Define `custom security rules` and override default Spring Security behavior[Define it as a `@Bean` in a `@Configuration` class]|
| `permitAll()` | Allow access to everyone `without security login` [Public APIs, Paths, CSS, Images, JS files ...]                                                |
| `denyAll()`   | Deny access to everyone used to `retire` a specific API temporarily with out removing the code [Testing Purposes]                                |
